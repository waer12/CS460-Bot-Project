Website: http://vindinium.org/


### Files
Some of the files are part of the Vindinium starter kit. Only some of it I use.

### MY Files
All of the files to run my bot and the Bot itself are located in the simple folder. 
* AStar.java 
* Dijkstra.java 
* GameGraph.java - this creates a graph and stores it in a 2D array. Not used since it gives me problems. GameGraph2.java is used instead.
* GameGraph2.java - This is somewhat similar to the AdvanceGameState.java file with my own modification for getting neighbor's.
* Mine.java - This is based on the Mine class from the Advanced Mine class 
* MyBot2.java 
* Pub.java - This is based on the Pub class from the Advanced pub class 
* TileNode.java - Similar to the Vertex class in the starter kit
